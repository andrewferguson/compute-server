# verify_node.sh <instance-id> — fail-loud post-setup verification for an
# inner-VM node (node0..machineNum).
#
# Runs as the FINAL startup service on every outer node that hosts an inner VM.
# Its purpose is to make a silently-incomplete node impossible: if the inner VM
# was never created, or was created but never joined the k0s cluster, this exits
# non-zero so CloudLab flags the node as failed instead of the experiment
# reporting "ready" while a controller/UE-hosting VM is actually missing. That
# silent mode is exactly what a transient /local/repository clone failure caused
# — the whole node was skipped and nothing noticed until the cluster was used.
#
# Every check targets THIS node's own inner VM only, so the verification is not
# racy against other nodes provisioning in parallel.
